Secret Sharing Master
Introduction
Secret Sharing Master is a Python-based application that implements a (k, n) threshold secret sharing scheme. In this scheme, a secret is divided into n shares, where only k or more shares can be combined to reconstruct the original secret. This application is built to ensure that sensitive data can be split among multiple participants in a secure way. Even if some participants are compromised, the secret remains protected until at least k valid shares are collected.

Features
Secret splitting: Split a secret into n shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.
Threshold reconstruction: Reconstruct the secret using any k out of n valid shares.
Secure and efficient: Ensures the confidentiality of the secret and provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for both splitting and reconstruction.
Customizable: Supports custom values for k (threshold) and n (total shares).
Cross-platform: Works on any operating system with Python support.
How It Works
Secret Sharing Master leverages Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, a cryptographic technique where:

A secret is split into n shares.
Any k or more shares can be used to reconstruct the secret.
Fewer than k shares provide no information about the original secret.
The key idea is based on polynomial interpolation, where the secret is encoded as a constant in a randomly generated polynomial of degree k-1. Each share represents a point on this polynomial, and the secret can be reconstructed by solving the polynomial equation.

Prerequisites
Before using the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pp11-web/Secret-Sharing-Master.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Secret-Sharing-Master
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Splitting a Secret
To split a secret into shares:

bash
Copy code
python secret_sharing.py split -s "your_secret" -n 5 -k 3
Where:

-s specifies the secret to be split.
-n is the number of shares to generate.
-k is the threshold number of shares required to reconstruct the secret.
The program will output n shares that can be distributed among participants.

Reconstructing a Secret
To reconstruct the secret from shares:

bash
Copy code
python secret_sharing.py reconstruct -k 3 -sh 1,2,3
Where:

-k is the threshold value used during the splitting process.
-sh is a comma-separated list of the share IDs being used to reconstruct the secret.
Example
Split a secret into 5 shares with a threshold of 3:

bash
Copy code
python secret_sharing.py split -s "my_secret_password" -n 5 -k 3
Output: 5 share strings.

Reconstruct the secret using any 3 of the generated shares:

bash
Copy code
python secret_sharing.py reconstruct -k 3 -sh 1,2,5
Output: The original secret "my_secret_password".
